                    Our Mission
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Our mission is to engage students in understanding and analyzing economic trends and policies through reading and writing. At IRT, we strive to cater to the academic and professional aspirations of our members. We are dedicated to creating a nurturing and enlightening environment where students can explore and deepen their understanding of economics, particularly in relation to current global events. Our unique approach lies in synthesizing complex economic concepts and news into digestible, thought-provoking content.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    The Writing Process
                </h2>

                <p>
                    IRT writers and editors meet regularly to brainstorm topics for upcoming articles, which are then agreed upon via voting and assigned to writers based on interest and capability. Writers write a 75-100 word paragraph each week in order to maintain a captivating piece that will hold readers' attention. Editors are in charge of editing roughly two writers’ paragraphs per week. IRT maintains 6 to 10 writers and 3 to 5 editors each year, who all have the opportunity to apply to be editor-in-chief for the following year.
                </p>
