# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

- Communicating regularly and being responsive, i.e. respond to messages and emails within 24 hours.
- Be honest and communicate any complications early.
- Complete responsibilities with proper effort and try not to leave anything to the last minute.
- Commit to weekly meetings (Tuesdays, 6:15PM on Zoom).

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

**Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

- Try not to interrupt others, wait until another person is done communicating their thought before speaking.
- Come to weekly meetings and keep your video camera and microphone audio on to ensure everybody is participating actively.
- Divide work equally and update others.
- Complete work a day in advance of the deadline to leave time to cross-check.
- Tell others when you push to Git in order to avoid messy merge conflicts.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

- Weekly meetings on Zoom on Tuesdays at 6:15PM
- Communication through iMessage and/or email.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

- We will communicate with the E-board meetings through Zoom or in-person depending on the client's preference. All other forms of communication will occur through email.
- We will work with them by discussing their goals during our meetings. Then, we will present our ideas and have them offer suggestions to make sure that we are meeting all of their goals and desires.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

**Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

- Team Coordinator: Someone that makes sure that everyone is doing their work. They will also be in charge of submitting the assignments. Once they submit, they forward the email submission to all other group members.
- Team Organizer: They take notes during the client meetings. They also take notes of any questions that the group may have so that they are able to ask the TAs and professors during office hours.
- Team Communicator: One person will be in charge of facilitating contact with the client. This will involve scheduling meetings, reminding them to send content, and answering all emails they send.
- Project Manager: Makes sure that all the files are ready for the team to submit. They will be in charge of checking citations, commits, etc. They will then communicate with the team coordinator to instruct them to submit the assignment.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- We will expect each team member to send biweekly messages in the groupchat, updating the other team members on what they have done for the work they were assigned. If someone does not appear to be contributing, we will message them in the group chat to ask for the reason behind their lack of work. If the team member does not deliver work by the 24 hour mark prior to the deadline, we will schedule an additional team meeting to ask that team member to update the team on their work progress. At that point, other team members will take on some of their work to make sure that the assignment is submitted on time. If this occurs repetitively, the group will email the TAs and Instructors to ask for additional assistance.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

- We will use a voting system.
- We will make sure everyone is heard and acknowledged.
- If there is a larger conflict, we will schedule a meeting to talk things out

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

- We will send a message and set up a team meeting to discuss the contract and if any changes need to be made. 

1.  What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

- We will get coffee as a reward for completing the project.

10. additional clause

- if there is a serious problem with completing the project or communicating and coordination with team members, we will contact our lab TAs. If that does not solve the issue we will contact the info 1300 email.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
